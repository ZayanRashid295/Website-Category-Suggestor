# Website Category Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict website categories accurately. Given a website, the model classifies it into predefined categories such as technology, sports, finance, etc. Below is a concise guide outlining the project's structure, usage, dependencies, dataset requirements, model training, evaluation, potential improvements, and avenues for contribution.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a labeled dataset comprising websites along with their respective categories.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize the dataset to prepare it for training.
3. **Model Training**: Utilize scikit-learn or similar libraries to train the machine learning model.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model for practical use, integrating it into applications or systems.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

Install dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
```
## Dataset
Collect a comprehensive dataset consisting of websites paired with their corresponding categories. Ensure rigorous preprocessing, including data cleaning and tokenization, before model training to enhance performance.

## Model
Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and deep learning architectures like LSTM or CNN, to determine the most effective approach for website category prediction.

## Future Improvements
- **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features such as metadata or URL structure to enhance model accuracy.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Employ ensemble techniques to combine multiple models for improved performance and robustness.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune model hyperparameters and preprocessing techniques to optimize performance.
